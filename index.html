      How This Works
    </h2>
    <p>
      The animals will be grouped together by which habitat they live in, such
      as the arctic animals go together. Some animals go by themselves or are
      mentioned twice, which means they are either endangered or are special.

      Arctic Animals
    </h2>
    <p>
      The Arctic Head North to enjoy an ice-cold adventure! The Arctic is
      located at the top of the Earth, and a big part of it is a frozen ocean.
      So as you go to the Arctic, careful not to stomp too hard, just in case
      your standing over the ocean! The frozen ocean area temperature goes down
      to about -40 degrees celsius, which makes it hard for animals to find
      food, as no plants can grow there. All the animals inhabiting the Arctic
      has developed to cope with the harsh conditions.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">The Animals</a>
      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">The Polar Bear</a>
      <br /><br />
      Even though it's spring in the Arctic, the temperatures only 0 degrees
      celsius. Polar bear mums have thick fur which keeps them warm when it's
      freezing. Their cubs are born in a den dug out of the snow, and when
      they're old enough, they walk on the Arctic ice.
      <br /><br />

      <b class="classify">Type:</b> Mammal<br />
      <b class="classify">Food:</b> Seals, small whales, and bird's eggs<br />
      <b class="classify">Sound:</b> Growl or chuff<br />
      <b class="classify">Baby Name:</b> Cub<br />

      <br /><br />
      Wild Fact: Polar bears can stand as tall as #.5 metres tall when standing
      on their hind legs!
      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">Reindeer</a>
      <br /><br />
      When winter arrives in the Arctic, reindeer join together into a group
      called herds. They travel south to find food and warmer weather than that
      of the harsh Arctic environment. Sometimes, half a million join the walk!
      When a group of animals travels long distances, it's called a migration.
      Reindeer migrations are some of the biggest migrations.

      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">The Puffin</a>
      <br /><br />
      Puffins gather on cliffs and spend most of their time at sea. In the
      spring, they lay their eggs in burrows. Puffins love to fish in the chilly
      water of the Arctic. They swim by flapping, as they are flying in the sea.
      <br /><br />

      <b class="classify">Group Name:</b> A circus<br />
      <br /><br />
      Wild Fact: A puffin's beak is spiky, so it can catch slippery fish. Also,
      a puffin's beak turns grey in winter.
      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">Water Mammals</a>
      <br /><br />
      Want to take a chilly dip? Go to the Arctic Ocean. The Arctic is
      surrounded by water, and its middle is ice. In the winter, the ice gets
      larger, but in the summer, it starts melting. Some mammals spend their
      whole lives in the Arctic Ocean, so they have bodies prepared for the
      cold.
      <br /><br />
      <a class="title">Water Mammal Facts</a>
      <br /><br />
      Polar bears can swim for weeks to find a new home.<br />
      Beluga whales have a thick layer of fat, called blubber, to keep them
      warm.<br />
      The long-tusked walrus spends some time in the water, some time on
      land.<br />
      The killing whale, or an orca, is actually a dolphin that can hold it's
      breath for an amazing 11 minutes.<br />
      The harpy seal pup starts to swim when it's just 6 weeks old.<br />
      <br /><br /><br />
      <a class="title">Wolves</a>
      <br /><br />
      When you think you're alone in the woods, you suddenly hear a piercing
      howl nearby. An Arctic wolf is near. Their white coats are hard to spot in
      the snow, which helps the wolf hunt with ease. The wolves hunt in packs
      and they howl to let every other wolf know where it is. As the ground is
      too hard to dig a burrow, they live in rocky caves.

      <a class="title">Arctic Animals</a>
      <br /><br />
      Some animals withstand the cold with thick fur or cosy feathers. Others
      fight it with a thick layer of blubber. Here are some other animals that
      live in the Arctic:
